# Examples

This folder contains examples that demonstrate various use cases and features of the entity-recognition library. The examples are categorized into three main sections: basic usage, advanced features, and integration samples. Each example is designed to showcase specific functionalities and provide you with code snippets that you can easily adapt and integrate into your own projects.


## Basic Usage

### Detailed Entity Recognition

The `detailed_entity_recognition.py` script serves as a starting point for understanding the core functionalities of the entity-recognition library. It demonstrates how to:

- Extract entities from text
- Classify the text into a topic
- Generate technology recommendations based on the extracted entities

This example provides a solid foundation for working with the library and understanding its basic usage.

### Process and Visualize Results

The `process_and_visualize.py` script showcases how to process text using the entity-recognition library and visualize the results in a readable format. It demonstrates how to:

- Create an instance of the `EntityRecognizer`
- Process text and obtain the recognition results
- Parse the JSON results into a Python list of dictionaries
- Iterate over the results and print them in a formatted manner
- Measure and display the execution time

This example is useful for understanding how to work with the recognition results and present them in a user-friendly way.

## Advanced Features

### Analyze and Visualize Results

For those looking to dive deeper into the capabilities of the entity-recognition library, the `analyze_and_visualize_results.py` script showcases advanced features. It illustrates how to:

- Analyze the recognition results
- Perform additional processing on the extracted entities
- Visualize the extracted entities and recommendations using popular data visualization libraries

This example is perfect for users who want to explore more advanced techniques and gain insights from the recognition results.

## Integration Samples

### Flask Integration

Integrating the entity-recognition library into web applications is a common use case. The `flask_integration.py` script provides a sample implementation of how to integrate the library with Flask, a popular Python web framework. It demonstrates:

- Creating a Flask application
- Exposing an API endpoint for entity recognition and recommendation generation
- Handling requests and returning the recognition results

This example serves as a starting point for building web applications that leverage the entity-recognition library.

### Streamlit Integration

For a more interactive and user-friendly experience, the `streamlit_integration.py` script showcases the integration of the entity-recognition library with Streamlit. Streamlit is a framework that allows you to easily build interactive web applications using Python. The example demonstrates:

- Creating a simple web app with Streamlit
- Accepting user input for text analysis
- Displaying the recognized entities and recommendations in real-time

This example is ideal for users who want to create interactive applications and provide a seamless user experience.
